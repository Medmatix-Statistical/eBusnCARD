An electronic Business Card Application. A freely distributable Java app that is a business card with benefits!

Email and on-line digital communication continue to grow as the way business is done in the new Millennium. However, the need for that compact piece of of stationary is unlikely to fully disappear, because the face to face meeting is not going to be fully replaced. However, more and more, face-to-face is going on-line as well; so what can replace that little courtesy so big a part of the culture of business?

To keep pace with the electronic paradigm of business, the concept of that "calling card" of business and commerce can be made even more relevant!!

But, the solution needs to be as easy and as versatile as that original little card while adapting transparently to new demands without any outward increase in complexity.

Here is the solution as we envision it.

Consider, a freely distributable and email-embeddable electronic business card that could export itself to all the usual contact managers. It by default displays itself as a graphic representation of a business card or it can print itself out in a typical business card format. It is intended to be a self-contained, smart business card which carries out a number methods including perhaps, multimedia presentations related to your business and services and also the potential of a larger data store of information about the business to retrieve in various forms.
